# MateMonkey.com Frontend

Hi! This is the Javascript frontend for [MateMonkey](http://matemonkey.com)
It is written using [AngularJS](https://www.angularjs.org/) and uses
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for displaying the map.

## Development

This project uses [Brunch](http://brunch.io) to build the final product.

### Installation / First Start

* Install nodejs
* Install brunch (e.g. using npm)
* Install bower (e.g. using npm)
* Install all development dependencies by running `npm install`
* Install all source dependencies by running `bower install`
* Start your local server by running `brunch watch --server`

### API

[Click here for the full API documentation](https://github.com/MateMonkey/api)

The frontend uses [playground.matemonkey.com](http://playground.matemonkey.com)
when built for development.
Have a look at `app/js/config/api.yaml` and the `urlfor` service that is
defined in `app/js/application.js` to learn how this works ;).

Please make sure that you always build the project for development if
you are creating a new feature/fixing a bug - otherwise you will change
production data! Thanks!
